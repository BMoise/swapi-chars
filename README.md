###Bootstrapped with Create-React-App

#Task

-Task is to build a web page that displays Star War characters in a table, using pagination. It should also allow the user to search for a specific character by name (powered by the API’s search parameter). This is the end goal but you’re obviously encouraged to make the UX as compelling as possible!
